This is selfextractor and payload deployment for bash.
Similar to makeself project but much more simplistic and not feature rich.
If you need something more robust and feature rich this is not for you.




1. Create payload folder and place inside your installer script and any additional payload files (apps, bin, txt, tar and etc...)
2. Run build.sh script to "compile" selfextractor.run from payload folder.
3. Copy selfextractor.run to host and run it as any bash script.
